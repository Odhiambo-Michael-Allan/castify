    "summary": "\u003cp\u003ePresident Trump wants higher tariffs, and he also wants more industrial production in the United States. This we know. In the meantime, a coterie of economists and pundits have tried to assemble a larger intellectual architecture to explain that strategy in a coherent way. The story they tell is one where America gets paid by its allies for national security and access to American markets, while the US brings down its debt and deficits, and weakens the dollar, so as to make US manufacturing more globally competitive. Whether Trump sees things this way himself, and whether it will actually work is an entirely separate question. On this episode of the podcast, we speak with Jim Millstein, co-chair of Guggenheim Securities, about what he sees as the massive risks underway with this line of thinking. During his time in government, he was closely involved with the conservatorship arrangement of the GSEs, so we also talk about the possibility of re-privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead more: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/dalio-warns-of-us-debt-crisis-heart-attack-within-three-years?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\"\u003eDalio Warns of US Debt Crisis \u0026#8216;Heart Attack\u0026#8217; Within Three Years\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-24/us-debt-crisis-won-t-be-solved-by-economists-wishful-thinking?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\"\u003eWishful Thinking Won\u0026#8217;t Solve the US Debt Crisis\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly Bloomberg.com subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox \u0026#8212; now delivered every weekday \u0026#8212; plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160;\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-destination\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

Momentum trades were hit particularly hard and stocks that had been winners for years suddenly became losers, while ones that had been losers suddenly outperformed. Perhaps the strangest thing though, is that volatility didn\u0027t really surge as things sold off. The VIX \u0026#8212; sometimes called Wall Street\u0027s \"Fear Gauge\" \u0026#8212; went up, but it didn\u0027t even reach levels that we saw in 2024 or 2022. So what happened?

There are plenty of people who feel that this law is an inhibitor of US growth, because domestic water-based shipment of goods requires a US-flagged, US-crewed, and US-built vessel.

There was a popular view that under Chair Lina Khan, the Biden FTC was overly stringent about what deals it would let go through, and that the new administration would give the greenlight more often. But at least so far, reality hasn\u0027t proven to be so simple. There hasn\u0027t been a big merger wave yet. And, in fact, the FTC under new Chair Andrew Ferguson has decided to keep the merger guidelines that Khan put in place. So does this mean continuity? At a live episode of the podcast taped in Washington DC, we spoke with Ferguson about the Trump administration\u0027s vision for antitrust. He talked about his philosophy of keeping corporate power in check and the tests he\u0027s using to preserve a competitive environment. He also walked us through the long history of the FTC and the notion of consumer welfare, plus why he thinks a more expansive interpretation of the term (beyond just lower prices) is in keeping with the history of conservative legal thought.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead More: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/3Fxcn4c\"\u003eNew DOJ Antitrust Chief Builds Team From Prior Administrations\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/3DJB0dq\"\u003eTrump\u0026#8217;s FTC Moves Ahead With Broad Microsoft Antitrust Probe\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly Bloomberg.com subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox \u0026#8212; now delivered every weekday \u0026#8212; plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160;\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-destination\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "author": "",
    "summary": "\u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"95\"\u003eHousing affordability remains one of the single greatest sources of economic stress. Even if inflation measures were to come down, the simple cost of shelter is a huge burden on a wide swathe of the population. Hardly anyone disagrees with the idea of increasing supply, but this is easier said than done. There isn\u0027t a lot of spare construction capacity and the political fights over liberalizing zoning are tedious and slow. On this episode, we speak with Kevin Erdmann, a senior affiliated scholar at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who proposes a simple idea. He argues that after the Great Financial Crisis, regulators over-tightened lending standards, and in so doing, took out the entire \"starter home\" segment of the new housing market. He says that if Fannie and Freddie were to liberalize their lending standards, homebuilders would be incentivized to build more homes that cater to people with lower incomes and lower FICO scores, essentially re-creating a whole slice of the new home market that\u0027s disappeared over the last 15 years.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"1158\"\u003eRead More:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomb/?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticleerg.com/news/articles/2025-03-06/us-homebuilders-face-a-supply-chain-snarl-from-tariff-battles\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003eUS Homebuilders Face a Supply Chain Snarl From Tariff Battles\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/us-mortgage-rates-decline-to-6-88-lowest-level-this-year?srnd\u003dundefined?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003eUS Mortgage Rates Decline to 6.88%, Lowest Level This Year\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"1230\"\u003eOnly \u003ca href\u003d\"http://bloomberg.com/\" aria-label\u003d\"http://Bloomberg.com\" data-testid\u003d\"inline-card-resolved-view\"\u003eBloomberg - Business News, Stock Markets, Finance, Breaking \u0026#38; World News\u003c/a\u003e subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox each week, plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160; \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

But even before the recent selloff, DeepSeek rattled the AI market and sparked questions over how US platforms will compete and actually monetize their technology. Despite all these hurdles, some investors remain tech optimists. Cathie Wood, the founder, CEO and chief investment officer of ARK Investment Management, is one of the most prominent, with ARK\u0027s Innovation Fund heavily invested in companies like Tesla, Coinbase and Roku. In this conversation, recorded live on stage at Bloomberg Invest, we discuss Cathie\u0027s view of potential opportunities in the space, and why she\u0027s expecting the Trump administration to create a Reagan Era-esque \"golden age\" for investors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead More:\u0026#160;\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/3FeMq9t\"\u003eCathie Wood Sees Trump Era as \u0026#8216;Golden Age\u0026#8217; for Wall Street\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/43yaCgY\"\u003eCathie Wood May Have Lost $14 Billion.

In 2019, the Chinese share of molecules licensed to Big Pharma companies was 0%. In 2024, it\u0026#8217;s now 31%. On this episode we speak with Tim Opler, a biotech industry investment banker at Stifel. He explains how this industry has taken off in such a short period of time. Among the factors he cites: a generation of Chinese research scientists working in the US who hit a ceiling in terms of promotion and thus went back home to start companies. It\u0026#8217;s also far cheaper to run clinical trials in China, due to the structure of the healthcare system.

    "author": "",
    "summary": "Dr. Keith Baar is a Professor at the University of California, Davis in the Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology. During his Ph.D. studies, his research revealed that mechanical strain on muscle fibers activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of muscular hypertrophy. Subsequently, he studied the molecular dynamics of skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance training under the guidance of Dr. John Holloszy, a legend in the field of exercise physiology, considered the father of modern exercise biochemistry. Building on all of this experience, he conducted research into tendon health and the potential for engineering ligaments, which could have implications for treatment and recovery from injuries.\n\nSponsors:\n\nCresset prestigious family office for CEOs, founders, and entrepreneurs: https://cressetcapital.com/tim (book a call today)\n\nAG1 all-in-one nutritional

    "summary": "This episode is part of a new experiment called Meditation Monday. The teacher, Henry Shukman, has been on my podcast twice before. He is one of only a few dozen masters in the world authorized to teach Sanbo Zen, and now, he’ll be your teacher.\n\nIn addition to my long-form interviews each week, every Monday I’ll bring you a short 10-minute or so meditation, which will help you for the rest of the week.\n\nOver this four-episode series, you’ll develop a Zen toolkit to help you find greater calm, peace, and effectiveness in your daily life.\n\nHenry’s app, The Way, has changed my life since I first started using it. Unlike other meditation apps, where you’re overwhelmed with a thousand choices, The Way is a clear step-by-step training program guided entirely by Henry. Through a logical progression, you’ll develop real skills that stick with you.\n\nI’ve been using it daily, often twice a day, and it’s lowered my anxiety more than I thought possible.\n\nAs a listener of my podcast, you can get 30 free sessions by visiting https://thewayapp.com/tim and downloading the app.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",

    "author": "",
    "summary": "Sales commissions act as a crucial lever to increase revenue and customers. But sometimes those incentives bring unintended consequences. New research identifies eight ways that salespeople across industries cheat or bend the rules to maximize their gain—often at the expense of the company\u0027s bottom line and customer loyalty. Huntsman School of Business professor Timothy Gardner and consultant Colin Wong explain these tactics, like sandbagging, falsifying data, and giving excessive discounts to close deals. The researchers also share how company leaders can audit, correct, and monitor an incentive program—and when they should let some practices slide to maintain productivity and motivation. Gardner and Wong are coauthors of the HBR article “How Salespeople Game the System.”",

He explains which type of learning leader works best in which contexts and how all three approaches can help individuals and teams reach the next level.

    "summary": "Despite all the ways that artificial intelligence promises to improve our lives, many consumers feel anxious and are averse to AI-powered products and services. For marketers and product managers, it’s vital to understand what is driving that resistance to adoption. Julian De Freitas is an assistant professor in the marketing unit at Harvard Business School. He has identified five main ways people see artificial intelligence negatively: that AI is opaque, emotionless, inflexible, autonomous, and not human enough. Through real-life cases and the latest research, he explains how companies can soothe anxieties and encourage consumer adoption.

Jason, Alex, and Lon break down Project Europe, a new $10M fund aimed at stopping the European startup brain drain. Plus, Anthropic’s revenue just jumped 40% in a single quarter, and we debate what that means for AI’s future. Meanwhile, China’s EV makers are coming for Tesla, Saudi Arabia is building a gaming empire with a $3.5B Pokémon GO buyout, and we ask the big question: Should X and XAI just merge? Since XAI gets real-time data from X, it’s got a major advantage—so what’s stopping them from becoming one?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimestamps:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(0:00) Alex, Jason and Lon kick off the show!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(1:29) Recap of Jason\u0026#39;s appearance on Glenn Beck\u0026#39;s show and advice to MBA students\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(4:21) The value of an MBA vs. starting a company(8:14) Nick Denton on Musk, Trump, and investment thesis\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(9:47 Squarespace.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eIn this episode of AI Basics, Jason sits down with Jia Li from LiveX AI to explore how human-like AI agents are changing the game for businesses. Instead of clunky bots, these AI agents engage customers in real-time, helping with onboarding, support, and even stopping them from leaving before they churn. We’ll break down how they work, why they feel more natural than traditional chatbots, and how companies can train them to eliminate costly mistakes. Plus, we’ll talk about whether AI-powered support might actually be better than human agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimestamps:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(0:00) Introduction to startup and AI basics(1:00) Collaboration with Google and insights from industry experts(1:44) Introduction of Jia Li and LiveX AI\u0026#39;s innovative customer retention(4:32) LiveX AI\u0026#39;s AI agent demonstration and training methodologies(9:38) Personalizing user experience with LiveX AI\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUncover more valuable insights from AI leaders in Google Cloud\u0026#39;s \u0026#39;Future of AI: Perspectives for Startups\u0026#39; report.

First, Alex interviews Zap Energy, where CEO Benj Conway explains how their breakthrough fusion power technology could provide unlimited, clean energy to fuel AI and beyond. Then, we talk to PolyAI, where CEO Nikola Mrkšić shares how their conversational AI is revolutionizing customer service with ultra-realistic, human-like voice assistants.

Predicting protein structure (AlphaFold 3, Chai-1, Evo 2) was a big AI/biology breakthrough. The next big leap is modeling entire human cells—how they behave in disease, or how they respond to new therapeutics. The same way LLMs needed enormous text corpora to become truly powerful, Virtual Cell Models need massive, high-quality cellular datasets to train on. In this episode, the teams discuss the groundbreaking release of the Tahoe-100M single cell dataset, Arc Atlas, and how these advancements could transform drug discovery.\nSign up for new podcasts every week.

Whether you’re stuck in a shame spiral, wondering why life feels pointless, or just trying to figure out how to not hate yourself so much, this episode is for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet a free sample pack with any drink mix purchase at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://drinklmnt.com/idgaf\" target\u003d\"_blank\" rel\u003d\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://drinklmnt.com/idgaf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUse code IDGAF to get 10% your health services at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://marekhealth.com/idgaf\" target\u003d\"_blank\" rel\u003d\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://marekhealth.com/idgaf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr. Julie’s new book, Open When: A Companion for Life\u0026#39;s Twists \u0026amp; Turns: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.amazon.com/Open-When-Companion-Lifes-Twists-ebook/dp/B0D3CB1XX6\" target\u003d\"_blank\" rel\u003d\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Open-When-Companion-Lifes-Twists-ebook/dp/B0D3CB1XX6\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr. Julie’s first book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Nobody-Told-This-Before-ebook/dp/B0983L6T32\" target\u003d\"_blank\" rel\u003d\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Why-Nobody-Told-This-Before-ebook/dp/B0983L6T32\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSign up for my newsletter, Your Next Breakthrough.

They aim to provide developers with the best possible experience when working on our code bases, even if that requires some temporary pain on the side of infrastructure teams that have to maintain multiple implementations at once.

But how do you know if your projects for improving developer experience are actually successful? For any other product, you would run an A/B test but that requires metrics and how do you measure developer productivity? Sarita and Moritz have been working on exactly that with Diff Authoring Time which measures how long it took to submit a change to our codebase.
