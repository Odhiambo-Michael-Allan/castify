    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eWhen Donald Trump won in November, one of the things that Wall Street was excited about was an expected liberalization of merger rules. There was a popular view that under Chair Lina Khan, the Biden FTC was overly stringent about what deals it would let go through, and that the new administration would give the greenlight more often. But at least so far, reality hasn\u0027t proven to be so simple. There hasn\u0027t been a big merger wave yet. And, in fact, the FTC under new Chair Andrew Ferguson has decided to keep the merger guidelines that Khan put in place. So does this mean continuity? At a live episode of the podcast taped in Washington DC, we spoke with Ferguson about the Trump administration\u0027s vision for antitrust. He talked about his philosophy of keeping corporate power in check and the tests he\u0027s using to preserve a competitive environment. He also walked us through the long history of the FTC and the notion of consumer welfare, plus why he thinks a more expansive interpretation of the term (beyond just lower prices) is in keeping with the history of conservative legal thought.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead More: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/3Fxcn4c\"\u003eNew DOJ Antitrust Chief Builds Team From Prior Administrations\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/3DJB0dq\"\u003eTrump\u0026#8217;s FTC Moves Ahead With Broad Microsoft Antitrust Probe\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly Bloomberg.com subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox \u0026#8212; now delivered every weekday \u0026#8212; plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160;\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-destination\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "summary": "\u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"95\"\u003eHousing affordability remains one of the single greatest sources of economic stress. Even if inflation measures were to come down, the simple cost of shelter is a huge burden on a wide swathe of the population. Hardly anyone disagrees with the idea of increasing supply, but this is easier said than done. There isn\u0027t a lot of spare construction capacity and the political fights over liberalizing zoning are tedious and slow. On this episode, we speak with Kevin Erdmann, a senior affiliated scholar at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who proposes a simple idea. He argues that after the Great Financial Crisis, regulators over-tightened lending standards, and in so doing, took out the entire \"starter home\" segment of the new housing market. He says that if Fannie and Freddie were to liberalize their lending standards, homebuilders would be incentivized to build more homes that cater to people with lower incomes and lower FICO scores, essentially re-creating a whole slice of the new home market that\u0027s disappeared over the last 15 years.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"1158\"\u003eRead More:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomb/?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticleerg.com/news/articles/2025-03-06/us-homebuilders-face-a-supply-chain-snarl-from-tariff-battles\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003eUS Homebuilders Face a Supply Chain Snarl From Tariff Battles\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/us-mortgage-rates-decline-to-6-88-lowest-level-this-year?srnd\u003dundefined?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003eUS Mortgage Rates Decline to 6.88%, Lowest Level This Year\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"1230\"\u003eOnly \u003ca href\u003d\"http://bloomberg.com/\" aria-label\u003d\"http://Bloomberg.com\" data-testid\u003d\"inline-card-resolved-view\"\u003eBloomberg - Business News, Stock Markets, Finance, Breaking \u0026#38; World News\u003c/a\u003e subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox each week, plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160; \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

Instead of planning ahead, they make impulsive decisions like committing $7,500 of earnest money to a new home that they can’t afford. Now, they’re questioning if they can still plan the wedding they want.\nThen we’ll meet Sara (28) and Jay (28) who are newly married and learning how to navigate finances together. Sara is a disciplined saver who avoids debt, while Jay is a big-picture dreamer—planning elaborate vacations without considering the cost. Sara has graciously agreed to help Jay pay off his debt, but was blindsided when Jay revealed the full amount post-honeymoon. Now, as they plan for homeownership and parenthood, trust and transparency are more important than ever.\nThis episode is brought to you by:\nDeleteMe | If you want to get your personal information removed from the web, go to https://joindeleteme.com/ramit for 20% off.\nFabric by Gerber Life | Join the thousands of parents who trust Fabric to protect their family.

Huntsman School of Business professor Timothy Gardner and consultant Colin Wong explain these tactics, like sandbagging, falsifying data, and giving excessive discounts to close deals. The researchers also share how company leaders can audit, correct, and monitor an incentive program—and when they should let some practices slide to maintain productivity and motivation.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eRolex is a series of paradoxes. They sell obsolete and objectively inferior mechanical devices for 10-1000x the price of their superior digital successors… and demand is stronger than ever in history! Their products are comparable to a Hermès Birkin bag in price, luxury status and waitlist times… yet they produce over 1m units / year (roughly 10x annual Birkin production). They make the most universally recognized and desired Swiss watches… yet their founder wasn’t Swiss and didn’t start the company in Switzerland! If Rolex were publicly traded, they’d almost certainly be among the top 50 market cap companies in the world… yet they’re 100% owned by a charitable foundation in Geneva that (among other things) literally just gives away money to local people in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTune in for one of the most fascinating and admirable companies we’ve ever covered on Acquired.

In fact, the last long-form video interview we could find was 17 years ago at the Computer History Museum… conducted by the one-and-only Jensen Huang! This episode came about after asking ourselves a version of the Jeff Bezos “regret minimization” question: what conversations would we \u003cem\u003emost\u003c/em\u003e regret not having if the chance passed Acquired by? Dr. Chang was number one on our list, and thanks to a little help from Jensen himself, we’re so happy to make it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDr. Chang shares the stories of a few crucial moments from TSMC’s history which have only been written about in his (currently Chinese-only) memoirs, including how TSMC won Apple’s iPhone and Mac chip business and a 2009 discrepancy with NVIDIA that almost jeopardized their relationship, and the lessons he took from them. We can’t think of a better way to kick off 2025.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eToday’s show: Europe wants to keep its founders from fleeing, AI is growing at breakneck speed, and Nick Denton is back with a spicy Twitter storm—so we had to talk about it. Jason, Alex, and Lon break down Project Europe, a new $10M fund aimed at stopping the European startup brain drain. Plus, Anthropic’s revenue just jumped 40% in a single quarter, and we debate what that means for AI’s future. Meanwhile, China’s EV makers are coming for Tesla, Saudi Arabia is building a gaming empire with a $3.5B Pokémon GO buyout, and we ask the big question: Should X and XAI just merge? Since XAI gets real-time data from X, it’s got a major advantage—so what’s stopping them from becoming one?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimestamps:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(0:00) Alex, Jason and Lon kick off the show!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(1:29) Recap of Jason\u0026#39;s appearance on Glenn Beck\u0026#39;s show and advice to MBA students\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(4:21) The value of an MBA vs. starting a company(8:14) Nick Denton on Musk, Trump, and investment thesis\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(9:47 Squarespace.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eIn this episode of AI Basics, Jason sits down with Jia Li from LiveX AI to explore how human-like AI agents are changing the game for businesses. Instead of clunky bots, these AI agents engage customers in real-time, helping with onboarding, support, and even stopping them from leaving before they churn. We’ll break down how they work, why they feel more natural than traditional chatbots, and how companies can train them to eliminate costly mistakes. Plus, we’ll talk about whether AI-powered support might actually be better than human agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimestamps:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(0:00) Introduction to startup and AI basics(1:00) Collaboration with Google and insights from industry experts(1:44) Introduction of Jia Li and LiveX AI\u0026#39;s innovative customer retention(4:32) LiveX AI\u0026#39;s AI agent demonstration and training methodologies(9:38) Personalizing user experience with LiveX AI\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUncover more valuable insights from AI leaders in Google Cloud\u0026#39;s \u0026#39;Future of AI: Perspectives for Startups\u0026#39; report.

From discussing the evolutionary roots of our search for meaning to examining the role of faith in modern life, this episode challenges conventional wisdom and offers fresh perspectives on age-old questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe cover a wide range of topics, including the importance of boredom in fostering creativity, the dangers of political activism as a substitute for religion, and the keys to a successful marriage.

Whether it’s metal fans in their forties or electronic music lovers growing older with their favorite DJs, we explore how the media landscape and algorithms have encouraged us to stick to what we know—and why this shift could be both a gift and a curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also dig into why “premium mediocre” is taking over our consumer habits, and whether or not that’s actually a bad thing. We discuss how these tiny, exclusive-seeming trends might be fooling us, offering superficial luxuries instead of anything truly valuable. We cap it off with a big question about whether chasing after anything is worth it, or if we’re just dooming ourselves to disappointment. Give it a listen.
