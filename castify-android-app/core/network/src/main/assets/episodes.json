Not the original Ten Commandments, but some of the newer, lesser-known ones. There\u0027s the Miner\u0027s Ten Commandments of 1853, the Ten Commandments of Umpiring, and the Ten Commandments for Math Teachers — just to name a few. (4 minutes)\n\nCommandments One, Two and Three: As a boy in religious school, Shalom Auslander is informed that his name, Shalom, is one of the names of God, and so he must be very careful not to take his own name in vain. (9 minutes)\n\nCommandment Four: Six houses of worship in six different cities, each with its own way of honoring the Sabbath. (3 minutes)\n\nCommandment Five: When Jack Hitt was 11, he did the worst thing his father could have imagined. Neither Jack nor his four siblings will ever forget the punishment. (6 minutes)\n\nCommandment Six: Alex Blumberg talks to Lt. Col. Lyn Brown, an Army Reserve chaplain who served two tours in Iraq. Brown talks about what \"thou shalt not kill\" means to soldiers on the battlefield. (6 minutes)\n\nCommandment Seven: In the book of Matthew, Jesus says that looking lustfully at a woman is like committing adultery in your heart. Contributor David Dickerson was raised as an evangelical Christian, and for many years tried not to have a single lustful thought. (9 minutes)\n\nCommandment Eight: Ira talks to a waiter named Hassan at Liebman\u0027s Deli in the Bronx about some audacious thefts he\u0027s witnessed in his years in the restaurant business. (3 minutes)\n\nCommandment Nine: Chaya Lipschutz wanted to donate one of her kidneys to a stranger. But to save a stranger\u0027s life, she had to break the commandment against lying. And the person she had to lie to was her mother. Chaya talked to Sarah Koenig. (8 minutes)\n\nCommandment Ten: Ira talks to seventh-graders about the things they covet most. (4 minutes)",

A simultaneously terrifying and delightful conversation about bird poop, daredevil drivers, and some staggering back-of-the-envelope math.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eRadiolab\u0027s original episode was produced and edited by Pat Walters and Soren Wheeler.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eIn this electrifying on-the-road episode of Club Shay Shay, Shannon Sharpe connects with Terence \"Bud\" Crawford at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas for an in-depth conversation that explores the mindset and techniques behind one of the greatest boxers of all time. The undefeated WBA Super Welterweight Champion lets Shannon in on his unmatched boxing technique, footwork, and mentality in a hands-on, unforgettable tutorial.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCrawford opens up about what has driven his meteoric rise, crediting two things: his unwavering belief in himself and his desire to prove the doubters wrong. Despite being the only male fighter to become a two-division undisputed champion in the four-belt era, he still feels underestimated, which only fuels his relentless drive. He reveals that he\u0026#8217;s not scared of losing power in a potential fight against Canelo, acknowledging the legend\u0026#8217;s skill but stressing the thrill of challenging himself in the ring.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGrowing up in Omaha, Nebraska, Crawford reflects on his roots and the impact it had on shaping him into the man he is today. He shares stories about his childhood in North Omaha, where he was raised by his mother and surrounded by family. Crawford notes the influence of figures like Malcolm X, Warren Buffett, and even the challenges of living in a city with both good and bad areas, which made Omaha a special place to raise his own family.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHe talks about the unique challenges he faced growing up without a strong male figure in his life, with his father\u0026#8217;s absence due to his Navy career. Despite being disciplined by his mother, Crawford credits his family and upbringing for his grounded mindset. In addition to discussing his upbringing, he shares poignant moments with figures like Warren Buffett, whose humble demeanor left a lasting impact on him.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs Crawford traces his journey from a young athlete to boxing champion, he recalls early struggles with his temper, which held him back in his early career. He reveals how the birth of his child and spiritual guidance from his uncle helped him turn his life around. Through the support of mentors like Tim Bradley and other key figures, Crawford was able to transition from fighting as an amateur to a professional, eventually becoming one of the most decorated names in the sport.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026#160;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e#volume\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "summary": "When you realize the line of work you’ve been in for years doesn’t interest you anymore or is in decline or won’t ever pay well enough, what’s your next move? Amy B speaks with executive coach Nina Bowman about the process of making a bold mid-career leap: how to identify a new path, build connections to land interviews, and tell the story of how you’ll succeed in a completely different role. Then, two listeners who made bold leaps themselves—one from academia to tech, the other from government to consulting—share their experiences and insights.",

    "summary": "A past guest recounts how she burned out, quit her job, intended to get a new job after taking a breather, and then didn’t for over a year. That’s because someone in her family kept getting sick or hurt, she had to move twice, and all of the logistical and emotional responsibilities fell to her (because who else was going to take them on?!) Sociologist Jessica Calarco helps her make sense of that exhausting year of unpaid work and the forces that put her and other women in this sort of position.",

The damage is highly visible in financial markets, but for the moment, shelves remain stocked, inflation measures have remained muted, and there hasn\u0027t been a significant wave of layoffs in official data. But according to our guest, real pain is coming. And what\u0027s going down is worse than a trade war. On this episode, we speak with the one and only David Woo, now the founder of David Woo Unbound. He also previously served as the Head of Global Rates, Foreign Exchange, and EM Fixed Income and Economics Research at Bank of America. He says that the administration has absolutely nothing to show for its initial months in office on any front. And he says this isn\u0027t a game of chicken, where one side can blink and avoid disaster. Instead, we\u0027re seeing a \"war of attrition\" where damage is being done to both the US and Chinese economies as we speak. As he sees it, the China hawks in the administration have been in control, and have the impulse to obliterate the Chinese economy, which makes the situation more than just a so-called trade war. He discusses the political, market, and real economy implications of this dramatic escalation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"1393\"\u003eRead more:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003eTrump U-Turns on Powell, China Follow Dire Economic Warnings\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-23/trump-push-for-ukraine-peace-carries-global-risks-from-a-bad-deal?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003eA Bad Peace in Ukraine Carries Global Risks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-renderer-start-pos\u003d\"1517\"\u003eOnly \u003ca href\u003d\"http://bloomberg.com/\" aria-label\u003d\"http://Bloomberg.com\" data-testid\u003d\"inline-card-resolved-view\"\u003eBloomberg - Business News, Stock Markets, Finance, Breaking \u0026#38; World News\u003c/a\u003e subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox each week, plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160; \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-testid\u003d\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark\u003d\"true\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

Under President Biden there was a whole host of new industrial announcements funded in part via the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. But did we get anything from these bills? Do we have anything to show for it? Why is building more capacity in the United States so difficult? On this episode, we spoke with Hassan Khan, who recently left his position as the director of economic security in the CHIPS Program Office at the Department of Commerce, about what he learned, what he saw, what could be done differently, and what the results are actually were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead more:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/42qo5qn\"\u003eWith US Chips Act Money Mostly Divvied Up, the Real Test Begins\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/4lISs2J\"\u003eTSMC\u0026#8217;s Arizona Chip Production Yields Surpass Taiwan\u0026#8217;s\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/42MxffP\"\u003eUS Chip Grants in Limbo as Lutnick Pushes Bigger Investments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnly Bloomberg.com subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox \u0026#8212; now delivered every weekday \u0026#8212; plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-destination\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul data-component\u003d\"unordered-list\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

With some $29 trillion outstanding, they create the benchmark that informs basically every other type of borrowing. Any changes to how the bond market works would be a massive deal. But lately, there\u0027s been a lot of chatter about how the Trump administration could radically restructure and refinance the US debt under the so-called \"Mar-a-Lago Accord.\" In this episode, we speak with University of Virginia law professor Mitu Gulati about how far the administration could go to legally reform this huge and important market.

Thanks to tech dynamism and general pro-growth US macro policies, American assets have far outstripped their global peers. Of course, there have been some bumps along the way, but they\u0027ve usually been global bumps. The financial crisis in 2008-2009 was global. Covid was a shock for the entire world. But with Trump\u0027s tariffs, we are now looking at a story that has the potential to be US-specific, even if a trade war will be felt internationally. And so investors are asking the question of whether US exceptionalism has come to an end, and there may be better opportunities elsewhere. On this episode we speak with Ozan Tarman, vice chair of global macro at Deutsche Bank. He tells us what his clients are thinking about and the various scenarios whereby US assets continue to underperform.

For one thing, rare earths aren\u0027t actually that rare. Furthermore, the amount of global trade of these minerals is fairly minuscule. The US only imports $170 million worth in a year. And then beyond that, the most common usage of them is in vacuum cleaners. Still, their economics are interesting and they do have some important applications.

New research identifies eight ways that salespeople across industries cheat or bend the rules to maximize their gain—often at the expense of the company\u0027s bottom line and customer loyalty. Huntsman School of Business professor Timothy Gardner and consultant Colin Wong explain these tactics, like sandbagging, falsifying data, and giving excessive discounts to close deals. The researchers also share how company leaders can audit, correct, and monitor an incentive program—and when they should let some practices slide to maintain productivity and motivation.

Almost \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e in a hospital — from patient interactions to billing, staffing, scheduling, prescriptions and even research — happens on Epic’s platform, and over 90% of American medical schools’ graduating doctors, nurses and health administrative staff are trained on it during their educations.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eWe flew to Taiwan to interview TSMC Founder Morris Chang in a rare English interview. In fact, the last long-form video interview we could find was 17 years ago at the Computer History Museum… conducted by the one-and-only Jensen Huang! This episode came about after asking ourselves a version of the Jeff Bezos “regret minimization” question: what conversations would we \u003cem\u003emost\u003c/em\u003e regret not having if the chance passed Acquired by? Dr. Chang was number one on our list, and thanks to a little help from Jensen himself, we’re so happy to make it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDr. Chang shares the stories of a few crucial moments from TSMC’s history which have only been written about in his (currently Chinese-only) memoirs, including how TSMC won Apple’s iPhone and Mac chip business and a 2009 discrepancy with NVIDIA that almost jeopardized their relationship, and the lessons he took from them. We can’t think of a better way to kick off 2025.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eIn this episode of AI Basics, Jason sits down with CapitalG partner Jill Chase to break down how AI is reshaping the startup ecosystem — from founders to investors to incumbents. They cover how CapitalG (Alphabet’s independent growth fund) thinks about the AI stack, why speed alone isn’t enough for startups today, and how to build durable advantages in a world where anyone can copy your product. Jill shares insights from portfolio companies like Motif (next-gen CAD for architecture) and Abridge (AI-powered doctor’s scribe), plus how startups can use AI “in the business” (product) and “on the business” (ops, GTM, etc). They also explore the transition from copilots to agents — and what that means for the next wave of software.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eToday’s show: Jason, Alex, and Lon talk about stories reshaping the startup world: 70mph drone deliveries are officially live in Dallas, with Zipline and Walmart promising groceries “as the crow flies” in under 5 minutes. Meanwhile, Trump slaps a 125% tariff on China and hints at a global economic shakeup — Jason warns founders to brace for layoffs and bankruptcies unless they’ve got a Plan B and C. Finally, a UK startup sells for $450M and VCs barely break even… but the founders walk with $20M. Jason explains how small exits create the most dangerous kind of founder: the one who never needs another check.

Crafting a strong data story means knowing your audience, structuring your insights around a clear problem, goal, action, and impact, and ensuring your narrative is not just persuasive, but ethical.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRahul Vohra \u003c/strong\u003eis the founder and CEO of Superhuman. Prior to Superhuman, Rahul founded Rapportive, the first Gmail plug-in to scale to millions of users, which he sold to LinkedIn in 2012. He is also a prominent angel investor, and his fund has invested $50 million in over 120 companies, including Placer, Supabase, Mercury, Zip, ClassDojo, and Writer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you’ll learn:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• The unexpected insight about virality Rahul gained from LinkedIn’s head of growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• Why Rahul restructured his entire executive team to spend 60% to 70% of his time on product, design, and marketing instead of the typical CEO responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• The counterintuitive approach to finding product-market fit using a methodical system inspired by Sean Ellis, and how this algorithmically determines your roadmap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• How manually onboarding every user (Superhuman had 20 full-time people doing this at peak) created superfans and allowed engineers to focus on product rather than onboarding flows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• The “Single Decisive Reason” framework for making better decisions by avoiding collections of weak justifications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• How

Megan sets the record straight on some of the craziest rumors she’s heard about herself - like being in the Illuminati, performing Satanic rituals, and what plastic surgeries she’s had done. She talks about her childhood, dysfunctional family dynamic, and how she never really fit in at school. Megan gets real about feeling different from everyone else and how that often left her feeling lonely. She opens up about her complicated relationship with her body, when she first started to criticize it, and why she’s never felt like a “sex symbol.” Megan discusses all the ways she’s been hyper-sexualized and brutally bullied by the media throughout her career and why she’s nearing her breaking point. Finally, she discusses the toxic romantic relationships she’s had in her past and even gives insight into her current relationship with MGK. Daddy Gang, get ready to learn so much about Megan Fox and truly see a side of her you’ve never seen before… Enjoy!",

Naisha also encourages listeners to be witnesses more than interpreters and how it’s equally important to witness yourself and your presence in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFollow\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHost: Chris Duffy (\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.instagram.com/chrisiduffy/?hl\u003den\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e |\u003ca href\u003d\"https://chrisduffycomedy.com/\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e Website\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://dallaslibrary2.org/poetry/youthpoetlaureate.php\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eYouth Poet Laureate of Dallas\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/roses-of-arma-naisha-randhar/17509088?ean\u003d9781639403479\u0026#38;next\u003dt\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eRoses of Arma\u003c/a\u003e by Naisha Randhar\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubscribe to TED\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstagram: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.instagram.com/ted/?hl\u003den\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e@ted\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYouTube: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/@TED\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e@TED\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTikTok: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event\u003dvideo_description\u0026#38;redir_token\u003dQUFFLUhqbXFocVNnRWFvUUcyWm1ib2psTkJ5RlVpOTRWZ3xBQ3Jtc0tuWkZaWEc3YzMwWkxubG9LdEJXMTBONkhOZ0VXSmtIaVFXZng3WmdEWVpUZ25BUFo1dk1jM21nanQxT2UzN25PQTNfLVVlMkw4ZVlwMUFTb05TRGJORHoxT3hoZjdfZFRQeDRBMlFIYkRJSEkwc3hhbw\u0026#38;q\u003dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40tedtoks\u0026#38;v\u003d9IFo0WjDvL4\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e@tedtoks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLinkedIn: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ted-conferences\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e@ted-conferences\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWebsite: \u003ca href\u003d\"www.ted.com\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eted.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePodcasts: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ted.com/podcasts\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eted.com/podcasts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the full text transcript, visit \u003ca href\u003d\"http://go.ted.com/BHTranscripts\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003ego.ted.com/BHTranscripts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp style\u003d\u0027color:grey; font-size:0.75em;\u0027\u003e Hosted on Acast.
