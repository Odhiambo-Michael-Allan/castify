This type of tech infrastructure has been a massive sectoral winner over the last few years. But of course, this isn\u0027t the first time investors have gotten excited about this type of trade. The late 1990s and early 2000s are often remembered as being the time of a \"tech bubble\" or \"dot-com bubble,\" but one specific aspect was the buildout in broadband infrastructure, or what became known as the telecom bubble. So what was that all about? Why were investors so optimistic? And how did it end? At our recent live episode in Washington DC, we spoke with Blair Levin, policy adviser to New Street Research. He was the chief of staff at the FCC during the telecom deregulation of the 1990s, and in the early 2000s went to work on Wall Street.

We sat down with Brad to talk about the roofing industry, his vision for improving the company, what other opportunities are out there, and what he\u0027s seeing in the general economy right now.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead more:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/qxo-agrees-to-acquire-beacon-roofing-supply-in-11-billion-deal?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\" data-prosemirror-content-type\u003d\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name\u003d\"link\"\u003eQXO Agrees to Acquire Beacon Roofing Supply in $11 Billion Deal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-25/affordable-housing-renovations-stalled-by-blocked-trump-administration-grants?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\" data-prosemirror-content-type\u003d\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name\u003d\"link\"\u003eAffordable Housing Developers Stalled by Blocked Federal Funds\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-prosemirror-content-type\u003d\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name\u003d\"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block\u003d\"true\"\u003eOnly \u003ca href\u003d\"http://Bloomberg.com\" data-inline-card\u003d\"\" data-card-data\u003d\"\" data-prosemirror-content-type\u003d\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name\u003d\"inlineCard\" data-prosemirror-node-inline\u003d\"true\"\u003ehttp://Bloomberg.com\u003c/a\u003e subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox each week, plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160; \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-prosemirror-content-type\u003d\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name\u003d\"link\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003ePresident Trump wants higher tariffs, and he also wants more industrial production in the United States. This we know. In the meantime, a coterie of economists and pundits have tried to assemble a larger intellectual architecture to explain that strategy in a coherent way. The story they tell is one where America gets paid by its allies for national security and access to American markets, while the US brings down its debt and deficits, and weakens the dollar, so as to make US manufacturing more globally competitive. Whether Trump sees things this way himself, and whether it will actually work is an entirely separate question. On this episode of the podcast, we speak with Jim Millstein, co-chair of Guggenheim Securities, about what he sees as the massive risks underway with this line of thinking. During his time in government, he was closely involved with the conservatorship arrangement of the GSEs, so we also talk about the possibility of re-privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead more: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/dalio-warns-of-us-debt-crisis-heart-attack-within-three-years?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\"\u003eDalio Warns of US Debt Crisis \u0026#8216;Heart Attack\u0026#8217; Within Three Years\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-24/us-debt-crisis-won-t-be-solved-by-economists-wishful-thinking?utm_medium\u003dreferral\u0026#38;utm_source\u003dpodcast\u0026#38;utm_campaign\u003dodd_lots\u0026#38;utm_content\u003darticle\"\u003eWishful Thinking Won\u0026#8217;t Solve the US Debt Crisis\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly Bloomberg.com subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox \u0026#8212; now delivered every weekday \u0026#8212; plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160;\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-destination\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

Momentum trades were hit particularly hard and stocks that had been winners for years suddenly became losers, while ones that had been losers suddenly outperformed. Perhaps the strangest thing though, is that volatility didn\u0027t really surge as things sold off. The VIX \u0026#8212; sometimes called Wall Street\u0027s \"Fear Gauge\" \u0026#8212; went up, but it didn\u0027t even reach levels that we saw in 2024 or 2022. So what happened?

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eWhen Donald Trump won in November, one of the things that Wall Street was excited about was an expected liberalization of merger rules. There was a popular view that under Chair Lina Khan, the Biden FTC was overly stringent about what deals it would let go through, and that the new administration would give the greenlight more often. But at least so far, reality hasn\u0027t proven to be so simple. There hasn\u0027t been a big merger wave yet. And, in fact, the FTC under new Chair Andrew Ferguson has decided to keep the merger guidelines that Khan put in place. So does this mean continuity? At a live episode of the podcast taped in Washington DC, we spoke with Ferguson about the Trump administration\u0027s vision for antitrust. He talked about his philosophy of keeping corporate power in check and the tests he\u0027s using to preserve a competitive environment. He also walked us through the long history of the FTC and the notion of consumer welfare, plus why he thinks a more expansive interpretation of the term (beyond just lower prices) is in keeping with the history of conservative legal thought.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead More: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/3Fxcn4c\"\u003eNew DOJ Antitrust Chief Builds Team From Prior Administrations\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bloom.bg/3DJB0dq\"\u003eTrump\u0026#8217;s FTC Moves Ahead With Broad Microsoft Antitrust Probe\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly Bloomberg.com subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox \u0026#8212; now delivered every weekday \u0026#8212; plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at\u0026#160;\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\" data-destination\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source\u003doddlotspodcast\"\u003ebloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href\u003d\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\"\u003eomnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a\u003e for privacy information.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "summary": "Dr. Keith Baar is a Professor at the University of California, Davis in the Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology. During his Ph.D. studies, his research revealed that mechanical strain on muscle fibers activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of muscular hypertrophy. Subsequently, he studied the molecular dynamics of skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance training under the guidance of Dr. John Holloszy, a legend in the field of exercise physiology, considered the father of modern exercise biochemistry. Building on all of this experience, he conducted research into tendon health and the potential for engineering ligaments, which could have implications for treatment and recovery from

But Prithriwaj “Raj” Choudhury, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, says it’s not a simple managerial choice between two options. He explains three main variations of hybrid work: quarterly, monthly, and weekly. And he shares three key challenges to remote work: isolation, communication, and socialization. And he breaks down the specific management practices necessary to make those hybrid arrangements succeed most effectively, adding that AI is making some of those practices easier and cheaper than ever.

    "title": "When Sales Incentives Backfire",
    "author": "",
    "summary": "Sales commissions act as a crucial lever to increase revenue and customers. But sometimes those incentives bring unintended consequences. New research identifies eight ways that salespeople across industries cheat or bend the rules to maximize their gain—often at the expense of the company\u0027s bottom line and customer loyalty. Huntsman School of Business professor Timothy Gardner and consultant Colin Wong explain these tactics, like sandbagging, falsifying data, and giving excessive discounts to close deals. The researchers also share how company leaders can audit, correct, and monitor an incentive program—and when they should let some practices slide to maintain productivity and motivation. Gardner and Wong are coauthors of the HBR article “How Salespeople Game the System.”",

His research shows this is true across industries and geographies, and he offers advice on how to improve in each area.

For marketers and product managers, it’s vital to understand what is driving that resistance to adoption. Julian De Freitas is an assistant professor in the marketing unit at Harvard Business School.

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eToday’s show: Jason, Alex, and Lon cover everything from wild political headlines to big moves in AI and venture. They kick things off with the surprising Trump pardon of Trevor Milton, the disgraced Nikola founder, and break down CoreWeave’s rocky IPO debut. Then, Jason and Alex sit down with Mariano Apodaca, founder of Prosperous AI, to talk about AI tools for negotiating construction and aerospace material costs. Later, in a brand new segment called \u0026quot;Office Hours with JCal,\u0026quot; Jason reacts to real founder feedback clips, pulls key startup lessons, and explains why building for a market that doesn’t yet exist might actually be your biggest edge. Along the way, the team explores the power of taking just 10% of the value you create — a pricing philosophy that could unlock your next big win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimestamps:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(0:00) Jason kicks off the show!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(4:05) Breaking news on CoreWeave and Founder University insights\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(9:21) Hubspot for Startups -

Then they sit down with three standout founders building the future across AI chips, data privacy, and healthcare. First up, Etched CEO Gavin Uberti explains why they’re betting big on transformer-specific ASICs. Then, Skyflow co-founder Anshu Sharma breaks down how they’re helping enterprises use LLMs without leaking private data. Finally, MedServe’s team walks us through how they’re securing medications in outpatient clinics and staying on the right side of the DEA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimestamps:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(0:00) Alex kicks off the show\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(1:15) 23andMe bankruptcy and SPACs impact\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(5:23) MicroStrategy\u0026#39;s Bitcoin strategy\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(8:58) Increase in M\u0026amp;A activity and market trends\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(10:06) Northwest Registered Agent - Get a 60% discount on your next LLC at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/twist\"\u003ehttps://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/twist\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(13:37) Browser use, agentic AI, and VC market insights\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(19:28) Financial responsibility in startups\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(20:28) Squarespace - Use offer code TWIST to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.Squarespace.com/TWIST\"\u003ehttps://www.Squarespace.com/TWIST\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(21:56) Interview with Gavin Uberti of Etched\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(30:32) Fidelity Private Shares℠ - Visit ⁠\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.fidelityprivateshares.com\"\u003ehttps://www.fidelityprivateshares.com\u003c/a\u003e !

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eIn this episode, we introduce the Domain Name System (DNS), the critical backbone of the internet that translates human-friendly domain names like \"educative.io\" into machine-readable IP addresses. We explore the hierarchical structure of DNS, where name servers work together to efficiently map domain names to IP addresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also dive into the different types of DNS resource records, explaining how they store name-to-value mappings, and how DNS leverages caching to boost performance and reduce query load. Additionally, we discuss the distributed, scalable, and reliable nature of DNS, including its use of replication and eventual consistency for updates. Finally, we take a hands-on look at practical DNS troubleshooting using tools like nslookup and dig. Join us to gain a deeper understanding of how DNS keeps the internet running smoothly!\u003c/p\u003e",

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRahul Vohra \u003c/strong\u003eis the founder and CEO of Superhuman. Prior to Superhuman, Rahul founded Rapportive, the first Gmail plug-in to scale to millions of users, which he sold to LinkedIn in 2012. He is also a prominent angel investor, and his fund has invested $50 million in over 120 companies, including Placer, Supabase, Mercury, Zip, ClassDojo, and Writer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you’ll learn:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• The unexpected insight about virality Rahul gained from LinkedIn’s head of growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• Why Rahul restructured his entire executive team to spend 60% to 70% of his time on product, design, and marketing instead of the typical CEO responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• The counterintuitive approach to finding product-market fit using a methodical system inspired by Sean Ellis, and how this algorithmically determines your roadmap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• How manually onboarding every user (Superhuman had 20 full-time people doing this at peak) created superfans and allowed engineers to focus on product rather than onboarding flows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• The “Single Decisive Reason” framework for making better decisions by avoiding collections of weak justifications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• How

    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eI’ve got a special episode for you today. I sat down in person with my longtime friend and first-ever podcast guest, Derek Sivers. We haven’t recorded live before, and honestly, it shows—in the best way. It’s raw, weird, and filled with the kind of conversations we usually when we’re just hanging out together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe dig into Derek’s new book, \u003cem\u003eUseful, Not True,\u003c/em\u003e and the big idea behind it: that our beliefs don’t need to be true to be helpful. That spins off into everything from remixing creative influences (metal + Dixieland jazz, anyone?) to why most podcasts—including mine—have gotten painfully predictable. We talk artistic reinvention, Bob Dylan, Bowie, Miles Davis, why most “thought leaders” are just regurgitating each other’s ideas, and why I\u0026#39;m ending the podcast as you know it—and what’s next!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also dive into the deeper stuff: the emotional power of belief, authenticity vs. performative vulnerability, therapy culture, and why sometimes the most liberating thing you can do is reject what everyone else thinks is necessary—relationships, kids, all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was one of the most honest, meandering, and creatively energizing conversations I’ve had in a while.

They aim to provide developers with the best possible experience when working on our code bases, even if that requires some temporary pain on the side of infrastructure teams that have to maintain multiple implementations at once.

But how do you know if your projects for improving developer experience are actually successful? For any other product, you would run an A/B test but that requires metrics and how do you measure developer productivity? Sarita and Moritz have been working on exactly that with Diff Authoring Time which measures how long it took to submit a change to our codebase.
